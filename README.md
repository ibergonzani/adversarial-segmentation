"# Adversarial Segmentation" 

folders
	- phantom: contains synthetic dataset of extremely simplified lungs tumor
	- dataset: contains brain tumor dataset
		1) brain_tumor_dataset = original data splitted among tumor categories
		2) brain_mask_dataset = original mask corresponding to original images of the dataset
		3) brain_tumor_dataset_splitted = preprocess data and masks (images divided in halves) classified as with (1) or without tumor (0)
		4) brain_gen_tumor_dataset = images generated by the netwrok as tumor free, divided in subfodler by tumor category
		5) brain_gen_mask_dataset = generated mask by the evaluation (using generated data and original one), divided in subfolder by tumor category
		6) brain_gen_diffs_dataset = differences between original images with tumor and generated one as tumor free, divided in subfolder by tumor category

"train_gan_keras.py" : train network architechture 2 (also 1 by changin network inside the code)
"train_autoencoder_gan.py" : train network architecture 3 (GANomaly). Save model  in ./models as encoder.h5, generator.h5
"evaluate.py" : use network model encoder.h5, generator.h5 to generate mask and evaluate model
